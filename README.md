# Simon-Game
This is a game that is modeled off the famous game Simon. <br>

So the way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on. <br>

As you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going to screw up, ðŸ¤ª
and then it's going to tell you that youâ€™ve got it wrong and the game is over. <br>

Then what you have to do, is to press any key to restart the game. <br>
Have fun!! ðŸŽ® ðŸ‘¾
