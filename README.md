# Simon-Gameâ„¢ <em>-Watch, Remember, Repeat!-</em>
This is an electronic game that is modeled off the famous Simon Game. <br>

So, the way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on. <br>

In each level, you have to repeat the previous sequence of buttons and add the new button that flashes in.

As you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going to screw up, ðŸ¤ª
and then it's going to tell you that youâ€™ve got it wrong and the game is over. <br>

Then what you have to do, is to press any key to restart the game. <br>
Have fun!! ðŸŽ® ðŸ‘¾
